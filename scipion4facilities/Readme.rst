There is a type of protocols called monitors which are used to produce live analysis plots, 
generate reports or raise alerts when some problems are detected. A monitor example is the CTF-monitor, 
that checks the computed defocus values for each micrograph as they are generated. 
CTF-monitor may raise an alert if the defocus values are above or below certain thresholds.
An special case of this monitors is the monitor summary which encapsulates the CTF Monitor, 
the system monitor and the movie gain monitor and continuosly creates a report.

This plug-in contains protocols and utilities related with monitors.
